Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

Why do we need data structure?
A.  In order to locate and retrieve data it is required to have data in a structured form. Structured form of data
    makes retrieval and manipulation easy.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A.  Following operations can be performed on different Data Structure:
        1. Searching
        2. Sorting
        3. Insertion
        4. Deletion
        5. Merging
        6. Traversing

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A.  List of areas in which data structures are applied extensively:
    Compiler Design,
        1. Operating System,
        2. Database Management System,
        3. Statistical analysis package,
        4. Numerical Analysis,
        5. Graphics,
        6. Artificial Intelligence,
        7. Simulation

What is an Array?
A.  An array in programming is a collection of data/value which has index associated with it. An array shall contain
    similar types of data, an array can be sorted or un sorted.

What is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A.  1. Array length if fixed but arraylist is dynamic.
    2. Array members are accessed using [], but ArrayList has a set of methods to access elements and modify them as
       because aerialist is collection of framework in java.
    3. Array can store primitive variables and objects but arraylist can store oly Objects.

What is LinkedList?
A.  A linked list is linear data Structure where each element is a separate object which is called node. Each node has
    data and reference to the next node. Last node has reference to null.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A.  1. An array element is having index number, but a node is having reference to next node.
    2. In array each element is independent, does not have any connection to the other element on the other hand in
       linked list each node are connected by previous node.
    3. In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous

  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
