Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

Why do we need data structure?
A.  In order to locate and retrieve data it is required to have data in a structured form. Structured form of data
    makes retrieval and manipulation easy.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A.  Following operations can be performed on different Data Structure:
        1. Searching
        2. Sorting
        3. Insertion
        4. Deletion
        5. Merging
        6. Traversing

    Compiler Design,
        1. Operating System,
        2. Database Management System,
        3. Statistical analysis package,
        4. Numerical Analysis,
        5. Graphics,
        6. Artificial Intelligence,
        7. Simulation

what is an Array?
